Question based on the topics of the prescribed syllabus will  <br>     be  set  for testing candidates ability  to  understand  the  <br>     content, explain words and phrases, making sentence of given  <br>     words  and  ability  to  summarise  will  be  included.  All  <br>     questions will have to be answered. <br> <br>     A.   from English Text Book             10 Marks <br>     B.   from Hindi Text Book                5 Marks <br> <br>Q2.  Candidates  will be required to write one  letter  (English)  <br>     and one letter in (Hindi) from a choice of two - <br> <br>     A.   English Letters                    5 Marks <br>     B.   Hindi Letters                      5 Marks <br> <br>Q3.  Report Writting on given outlines  5 Marks <br> <br>Q4.  There will be a number of short answer questions to test the  <br>     candidates  knowledge of functional grammer,  structure  and  <br>     usage  of the language. All the items in this question  will  <br>     be compulsory. The grammar questions has four parts - <br> <br>     (Total Part: A For 5 Marks, B For 3 Marks, C For 3 Marks and  <br>     D For 4 Marks) <br> <br>     A.   This   part  of  the  question  has  to  do  with   the  <br>          transformation  of  sentences.  English  uses   several  <br>          patterns of sentence formation and the same meaning can  <br>          be expresed by several patterns e.g. Active to  Passive  <br>          voice  and  vice  versa, Direct to  Indirect  and  vice  <br>          versa,  Reframing sentences by changing part of  speech  <br>          e.g   Noune  to  Adjective,  Interchanging  degree   of  <br>          comparison. <br> <br>          Interchanging   Moods   -  Affirmative   to   Negative,  <br>          Assertive to Interrogative or to exclamatory  <br> <br>     B.   The  second part usually requires blanks in a  sentence  <br>          to  be  filled  in  with  a  suitable  preposition  and  <br>          articles. <br> <br>     C.   The third part is usually an exercise on tenses. <br> <br>     D.   The fourth part concerns with one word substitution and  <br>          abbrevation, uses of idioms and Phrases, Homophones. <br> <br>Q5.  COMPOSITION : (About 300 Words) (5 marks) <br> <br>     Candidates will be required to select one composition  topic  <br>     from  a  choice of five. The choice  will  normally  include  <br>     narrative   descriptive,  argumentative,    discussion   and  <br>     factual  topics. The main ceteria by which  the  composition  <br>     will be marked are as follows <br> <br>A.   the  quality  of  the  language  employed,  the  range   and  <br>     appropriateness  of  vocabulary and sentence  structure  the  <br>     correctness  of  grammatical construction,  punctuation  and  <br>     spelling. <br> <br>B.

The translation of ideas into practice without the  <br>    use  of this graphic language is really  beyond  imagination.  <br>    Thus, for the effective and efficient communication among all  <br>    those involved in an industrial system, it becomes  necessary  <br>    that  the perosonnel working in different capacities  acquire  <br>    appropriate  skills  in the use of this graphic  language  in  <br>    varying  degrees of proficiency in accordance with their  job  <br>    requirements. <br>            Generally speaking, an engineering technician working  <br>    at  the  middle  level of the  threetier  technical  manpower  <br>    spectrum,  is required to read and interpret the designs  and  <br>    drawings, providedto him by technologists and subsequently to  <br>    translate  them to the craftsmen for actual execution of  the  <br>    job. <br>            This course in Engineering Drawing has been designed,  <br>    keeping  in  view,  the  above refered  job  functions  of  a  <br>    technician  in the industry. This preliminary course aims  at  <br>    building a foundation for the further courses in drawing  and  <br>    other allied subjects.  The contents of the course have  been  <br>    selected as to form a core for the various deversified fields  <br>    of  engineering.  It  is expected that at  the  end  of  this  <br>    session,  the students acqures sufficient skill drafting  and  <br>    some ability in spetial visualization of simple objects. <br>________________________________________________________________ <br>Sl.N.
